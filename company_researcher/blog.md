# Building a Multi-Agent Company Research System: A Technical Deep Dive

## Introduction

In today's fast-paced business environment, conducting comprehensive company research requires processing vast amounts of information from diverse sources. Traditional approaches often struggle with the complexity and scale of this task. This blog post details our implementation of a sophisticated multi-agent system designed specifically for company research.

Our solution leverages the power of specialized AI agents, each focused on specific aspects of company analysis, coordinated by a central intelligence. This approach not only enhances the depth and breadth of research but also ensures consistent, well-organized outputs.

## System Architecture

### Core Components

Our system is built on three fundamental pillars:

1. **Chief Research Coordinator**: The central orchestrator that manages the entire research process
2. **Specialized Research Agents**: A team of focused agents, each handling specific research domains
3. **Integration Layer**: A robust framework that enables seamless communication and data synthesis

### Agent Hierarchy and Communication

At the heart of our system lies a hierarchical structure with the Chief Research Coordinator at the helm. Here's how we implemented this structure:

```python
# Core agent structure
chief_research_agent = Agent(
    name="Chief Research Coordinator",
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o-mini"),
    team=[
        business_news_agent,
        financial_news_agent,
        market_strategy_agent,
        reputation_social_agent,
        legal_compliance_agent
    ],
    role="Coordinate and synthesize comprehensive company research"
)
```

This structure enables efficient task delegation and information flow, with each specialized agent reporting back to the coordinator for final synthesis.

## Technical Implementation

### Framework and Technologies

Our implementation is built using the Phi framework, a powerful toolkit for creating and managing AI agents. The core technologies include:

```python
from phi.agent import Agent
from phi.playground import Playground
from phi.model.openai import OpenAIChat
```

This stack provides several advantages:
- Robust agent management
- Built-in communication protocols
- Efficient state management
- Extensible architecture

### Agent Implementation Details
-

The system's intelligence is distributed across specialized agents, each with specific responsibilities:

1. **Chief Research Coordinator**
   The coordinator is configured with sophisticated instructions for managing the research process:
   ```python
   instructions = [
       """
       COORDINATION APPROACH:
       1. Research Planning:
          - Determine which specialized agents to engage
          - Prioritize research areas
          - Ensure comprehensive coverage
       
       2. Data Collection:
          - Delegate specific research tasks
          - Monitor information quality
          - Identify data gaps
       
       3. Analysis Integration:
          - Synthesize findings
          - Identify patterns
          - Resolve contradictions
       """
   ]
   ```

2. **Specialized Agents**
   Each agent is designed to focus on specific aspects of company research:
   ```python
   from news.business_news import business_news_agent
   from news.financial_news import financial_news_agent
   from news.market_strategy import market_strategy_agent
   from news.reputation_social import reputation_social_agent
   from news.legal_compliance import legal_compliance_agent
   ```

### Specialized News Agents
Our system employs five specialized agents, each focusing on specific aspects of company research:

1. **Business News Agent**
```python
business_news_agent = Agent(
    name="Business News Agent",
    tools=[
        query_business_news,
        query_financial_data,
        query_operations_data,
        query_company_info,
        query_innovation_data
    ],
    role="Search for comprehensive business news and company information"
)
```
Key Focus:
- Chain of thought reasoning with 3-5 key claims
- Historical data comparison
- Quantitative metrics analysis
- Innovation and growth tracking

2. **Financial News Agent**
```python
financial_news_agent = Agent(
    name="Financial News Agent",
    tools=[
        query_business_news,
        query_financial_data,
        query_market_data,
        query_risk_data
    ],
    role="Analyze financial information and market performance"
)
```
Key Metrics:
- Revenue Analysis: YoY growth >5%, QoQ >2%
- Profitability: EBITDA margins >15%
- Market Performance: Daily changes >2%
- Financial Health: Liquidity and solvency ratios

3. **Legal Compliance Agent**
```python
legal_compliance_agent = Agent(
    name="Legal and Compliance Agent",
    tools=[
        query_legal_data,
        query_crime_news,
        query_company_info,
        query_risk_data
    ],
    role="Analyze legal status, compliance, and regulatory risks"
)
```
Focus Areas:
- Active Litigation (>$1M impact)
- Regulatory Investigations
- Compliance Assessment
- Risk Analysis and Controls

4. **Market Strategy Agent**
```python
market_strategy_agent = Agent(
    name="Market Strategy Agent",
    tools=[
        query_market_data,
        query_company_info,
        query_innovation_data,
        query_business_news
    ],
    role="Analyze market position and competitive landscape"
)
```
Key Analysis:
- Market Share Tracking (>0.5% changes)
- Innovation Assessment (R&D >5% of revenue)
- Competitive Intelligence
- Growth Metrics (>15% YoY target)

5. **Reputation & Social Agent**
```python
reputation_social_agent = Agent(
    name="Reputation and Social Impact Agent",
    tools=[
        query_social_media,
        query_reputation_data,
        query_public_sentiment
    ],
    role="Analyze social reputation and brand image"
)
```
Key Indicators:
- Social Media Engagement (>3% rate)
- Brand Sentiment Analysis (>60% positive)
- CSR Investment (>1% of revenue)
- Crisis Management (<2hr response)

Each agent operates with specific thresholds and metrics, ensuring comprehensive coverage of all aspects of company research. The agents work in concert, sharing information through the Chief Research Coordinator to produce detailed, multi-faceted analysis.

### Search Infrastructure
Our system leverages SearXNG, a privacy-respecting metasearch engine, as its core search infrastructure. The implementation includes sophisticated search capabilities:

```python
def searxng_client():
    searxng = Searxng(
        host="http://192.168.1.39:8080",
        engines=[],
        fixed_max_results=3,
        news=True,
        science=True,
    )   
    return searxng
```

The SearXNG toolkit provides specialized search functions for different aspects of company research:
- Business and financial news queries
- Political and regulatory monitoring
- Market and competitor analysis
- Reputation and social media tracking
- Legal and compliance information

### Integration Features


Our integration layer ensures smooth operation across all components:

```python
chief_research_agent = Agent(
    add_history_to_messages=True,
    markdown=True,
    reasoning=True,
    show_full_reasoning=True,
    show_tool_calls=True,
